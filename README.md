Chocolatey packages I use

These are the chocolaty packages I use on my PC.
If you'd like to use this file install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
And run the config file with [choco install packages.config](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-install)

Note: I would recommend forking and creating your own version of packages.config so that way you can install your own desired programs
You can find more [chocolatey packages here](https://chocolatey.org/packages)
